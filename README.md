Tutorial about understanding Git and GitHub better. Also, maybe, some brainstorming will be done here.

Hello, World!

I am Dimitris Doxopoulos, a self tought programmer and web developer.
Everything started with my thesis project where I had to use Matlab 
to produce a software that would make estimates for how much water would
be flowing on ittermitent flow rivers around the Mediterranean Sea. The
models used for this were using anual rainfall data and the predictions were
made were starting for 10 years to 100 years ahead.

Next stop was Python, where my passion for coding started to develop. Python
is the perfect language for someone who wants to learn how to code from scratch.
Very simple, elegant and with so many ways to be applied.

Then I started learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. Also some Java. Then I got
my certificate as a Web and Application Developer.

Now I'm trying to get my knowledges boosted on Web Design and Web Development, having
a special interest for back-end development but still being interested in front-end also.

Other passions that I have are gaming, reading, board games, playing the guitar
(still a noob, though) and others..!
